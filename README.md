# A Comparison of Deep Q-Learning Methods for Solving Space Invaders

In this project we compared three DQN networks for solving the Space Invaders Atari environment.

## Code Notebooks:

* DQN with fixed target network and experience replay trained on RAM input - dqn.ipynb

* DQN with fixed target network and prioritised experience replay trained on pixel input - dqn_PER_pixels.ipynb

* Duelling Double Q-Network trained on RAM input - DDQN.ipynb


## Dependencies:

We used the following packages during the implementation:

* gym[atari]

* tensorflow

* numpy 

* cpprb

* matplotlib

* pandas

* cv2

* os
